This work is written by group cs-22-pt-9-03 during the 9th semester the Master of Computer Science as a part of the "Specialization course in Programming Technology" course at Aalborg University. The goal of the work is to compare existing software measuring instruments to measure the energy consumption of a computer, in order to find the best performing measuring instrument for both Windows and Linux. We would like to express appreciation to our supervisors, Lone and Bent Leth Thomsen from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University and Kenneth Knirke from the Department of Electronic Systems at Aalborg University, for their crucial guidance in this project.

% This report is written by project group D508e20, during the fifth semester of the Bachelor of Computer Science. It is part of the course ”Experimental Data Analysis and Modeling” at Aalborg University. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model, which can classify traffic signs with robust accuracy when exposed to noise. We would like to express appreciation to our supervisor, Alessandro Tibo from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University, for his crucial guidance in this project.
