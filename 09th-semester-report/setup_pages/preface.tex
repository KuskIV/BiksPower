This work is written by group cs-22-pt-9-03 during the 9th semester of the Master of Computer Science as a part of the "Specialization course in Programming Technology" at Aalborg University. The goal of the work is to compare existing software measuring instruments able to measure the energy consumption of software, in order to find the best performing measuring instrument for both Windows and Linux. We would like to express appreciation to our supervisors, Lone and Bent Leth Thomsen from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University and Kenneth Knirke from the Department of Electronic Systems at Aalborg University, for their crucial guidance in this project.
