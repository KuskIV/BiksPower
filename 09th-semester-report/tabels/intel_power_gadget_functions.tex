% Returns the data collected by the most recent call to ReadSample(). The returned data is for the data on the package specified by iNode, from the MSR specified by iMSR. The data is returned in pResult, and the number of double results returned in pResult is returned in nResult. Refer Table 1: MSR Functions.

% The data collected by the most recent ReadSample() is returned. The data returned is only for the package iNode specified, from the iMSR MSR specified. pResult represents the data returned, and nResults represents the number of double results in pResult.

% Starts saving the data collected by ReadSample() until StopLog() is called. Data will be written to the file specified by szFileName.

% Data is collected and written to the file specified by calling \texttt{ReadSample()} until \texttt{StopLog()} 

% Stops saving data and writes all saved data to the file specified by the call to StartLog().

% All the saved data is written to the file specified in the \texttt{StartLog()} call, and stops saving data.
