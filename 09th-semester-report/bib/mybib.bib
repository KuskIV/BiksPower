  abstract = {Abstract Mobile devices and accessing the web have become essential in our daily lives. However, their limitations in terms of both hardware such as the battery, and software capabilities can affect the user experience such as battery drain. There are some best practices for the web page design that are shown to affect the downloading time of web pages. In this study, we report our experience in applying these practices to see their effect on energy saving. We propose two techniques: (1) concatenating external script and stylesheet files and (2) minifying external script and stylesheets that can be used to transcode web pages to improve energy consumption on the client-side and therefore improve the battery life. We present our experimental architecture, implementation, and a systematic evaluation of these two techniques. The evaluation results show that the proposed techniques can achieve approximately 12\% processor energy-saving and 4\% power saving in two different client types, 13\% improvement in a typical laptop battery life, and 4\% improvement in a typical mobile phone battery life.},

  abstract   = {Measuring the energy consumption of software components is a major building block for generating models that allow for energy-aware scheduling, accounting and budgeting. Current measurement techniques focus on coarse-grained measurements of application or system events. However, fine grain adjustments in particular in the operating-system kernel and in application-level servers require power profiles at the level of a single software function. Until recently, this appeared to be impossible due to the lacking fine grain resolution and high costs of measurement equipment. In this paper we report on our experience in using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy sensors available in recent Intel CPUs for measuring energy consumption of short code paths. We investigate the granularity at which RAPL measurements can be performed and discuss practical obstacles that occur when performing these measurements on complex modern CPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the RAPL infrastructure to characterize the energy costs for decoding video slices.},

Energy profilers provide a means to measure the energy consumption of software, enabling the user to take measures in making software more sustainable. Although each energy profiler has access to roughly the same data, the reported measurements can differ significantly between energy profilers. In this research, energy profilers are evaluated through a series of experiments on their functionality and the accuracy of the reported measurements. The results show that there is still work to be done before these software tools can be safely used for their intended purpose. As a start, a correction factor is suggested for the energy profilers.},

Even though RAPL and its supporting software interfaces can benefit power management significantly, they are unfortunately designed without taking certain security issues into careful consideration. In this paper, we demonstrate that information leaked through RAPL-induced side channels can be exploited to mount realistic attacks. Specifically, we have constructed a new RAPL-based covert channel using a single AVX instruction, which can exfiltrate data across different boundaries (e.g., those established by containers in software or even CPUs in hardware); and, we have investigated the first RAPL-based website fingerprinting technique that can identify visited webpages with a high accuracy (up to 99% in the case of the regular network using a browser like Chrome or Safari, and up to 81% in the case of the anonymity network using Tor). These two studies form a preliminary examination into RAPL-imposed security implications. In addition, we discuss some possible countermeasures.},

More concretely, we show that side-channel attacks can be established using software-based energy measurement at the example of a popular RSA implementation. Using distinguishing experiments, we identify a side-channel vulnerability that enables attackers to distinguish RSA keys by measuring energy consumption. We demonstrate that a surprisingly low number of sample measurements suffices to succeed in an attack with high probability. In contrast to traditional power side-channel attacks, no physical access to hardware is needed. This makes the vulnerabilities particularly serious.},

  abstract = {Software is a fundamental part of today's society. However, both users and software professionals need to be aware that its use impacts on the environment, due to the high energy consumption it entails. One of the main gaps to be faced is the difficulty of analyzing software energy consumption in the endeavor to know whether a particular software product is as much energetically efficient as possible, or at least more efficient than another, and to improve the environmental objectives of the software. For this reason, a Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve eNviromental Goals of the Software (FEETINGS) is presented in this paper. FEETINGS is composed of three main components: an ontology to provide precise definitions and harmonize the terminology related to software energy measurement; a process to guide researchers in carrying out the energy consumption measurements of the software, and a technological environment, which allows the capture, analysis and interpretation of software energy consumption data. This paper also presents an example of the application of the FEETINGS, which aims to raise awareness of the energy consumed by the software in activities that we perform daily, such as writing a tweet or a Facebook post. As a result, we have been able to verify that FEETINGS allows us to carry out an analysis and measurement of software energy consumption to provide users with good practices, as using an emoji or a picture rather than a GIF. © 2001 Elsevier Science.

  abstract = {Although software measurement plays an increasingly important role in Software Engineering, there is no consensus yet on many of the concepts and terminology used in this field. Even worse, vocabulary conflicts and inconsistencies can be frequently found amongst the many sources and references commonly used by software measurement researchers and practitioners. This article presents an analysis of the current situation, and provides a comparison framework that can be used to identify and address the discrepancies, gaps, and terminology conflicts that current software measurement proposals present. A basic software measurement ontology is introduced, that aims at contributing to the harmonization of the different software measurement proposals and standards, by providing a coherent set of common concepts used in software measurement. The ontology is also aligned with the metrology vocabulary used in other more mature measurement engineering disciplines.}
