\section{Experiment \#2}\label{sec:experiment_two}

During Experiment \#1 in \cref{sec:experiment_one}, a few observations differed from our expectations. This was first of all regarding Linux having a lower energy consumption than Windows when comparing the clamp measurements, and second of all that the energy consumption of the idle test case is lower compared to the expected energy consumption of the different DUTs covered in \cref{subsec:expec_energy_consumption}. Because of this, a second experiment was introduced to look into this. One difference between the first and second experiments is how many test case measurements were made. In the first experiment, $120$ was made, but this was found in \cref{subsec:CockUse} to be too many. In this experiment, only $20$ measurements were made.\todo{men ikke for idlecase?} 

\paragraph*{}
This experiment will aim to uncover why the idle test case had a lower energy consumption than expected. The expectation is that the low energy consumption measured on the idle test case also impacts the dynamic energy consumption on the different OSs, resulting in higher energy consumption for Windows.

\paragraph*{}
An example of the idle test case energy consumption being lower than expected can be observed in \cref{fig:TestCaseIdle_Cores_comparison_energy_without_outliers_PowerKomplett_avg_watts}. Here the idle test case's median energy consumption is reported by Intel Power Gadget to be $2.24W$ on the workstation, where the expectations were between $10W$ and $65W$. Because of this, some further investigation into the results was conducted. In terms of why the measurements were so low, a few things could have caused it, which will be covered now.
