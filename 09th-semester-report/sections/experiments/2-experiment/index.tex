\section{Experiment \#2}\label{sec:experiment_two}

During Experiment \#1 in \cref{sec:experiment_one}, a few observations made seemed to different compared to expectations. This is first of all regarding that Linux had a lower energy consumption than Windows when comparing the clamp measurements, and second of all that the energy consumption of the idle test case is lower compared to the expected energy consumption of the different DUT's covered in \cref{subsec:expec_energy_consumption}. Because of this, a second experiment was introduced to look into this.
