\subsection{Idle Experiment}\label[subsec]{subsec:idleExperiment}
During the previous experiment from \cref{subsec:TempBat}, it was observed that the idle experiments were significantly lower than the expectations from \cref{subsec:expec}, therefore some further investigation into the results was conducted. This was true for all of the software based measuring methods, while the Hardware measurements was within the lower range of the expectations. Initially we expected some erroneous implementation on our part when making the idle testCase. The original idle testCase, was implemented using Thread.Sleep(), so we tried replacing this part of the testCase with a Task.Delay() instead to see if it had any effect on the results. The results from this was identical to the previous results, so we ruled out problems with the testCase itself. The next step was looking into p-stats and c-stats
