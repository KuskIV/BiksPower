\subsection{Anomalies Detection}\label[subsec]{subsec:anomalies_detection}

Anomaly detection was found  to be an important tool to avoid corrupted results as covered in \cref{subsec:anomalies}. For this, the DBSCAN algorithm was found to be the algorithm of choice in order to find anomalies in the data.

\paragraph*{}
An example of for a test case measurement for the workstation is shown in \cref{fig:anomaly_detection_example}. The example is for the test case fasta and is measured by the LHM, where the same operation was conducted for all other test case measurements, as described below.

The algorithm is described in the work by Ester et al.\cite{ester1996density}. In order to use this algorithm, the value of two parameters needs to be decided, this being \texttt{Eps} and \texttt{MinPts}. In order to do this, a \texttt{k-dist} function is defined, where $k$ represents the distance from a point to its $k$'th neighbor. This function is applied to all measurements, and is plotted based on descending order with regards to the distance. This is called the sorted k-dist graph, an can be seen in \cref{fig:4-dist}. The next step is to choose a threshold point, which is the last point in the first "valley" on the graph. All points with a higher k-dist value will then be considered to be noise. The \texttt{MinPts} will in this case be set to \texttt{k}, and \texttt{Eps} will be the $y$ value of \texttt{k-dist(p)}. When finding this "valley", it is noted in the work by Ester et al.\cite{ester1996density} to be very difficult to find the "valley" in an automatically manner, but it is however easy for a user to see this. Because of this, the process is done manually for all cases. In this example the first valley is marked in \cref{fig:4-dist} with a dotted line, where the \texttt{Eps} parameter is set to $0.00105$. Based on this, the outliers can be found, and removed. This is illustrated in \cref{fig:outliers}, where it can be seen which outliers (marked in red) are found.
