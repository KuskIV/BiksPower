\section{Initial Experiments}\label{sec:initial_experiments}

In this section, some initial experiments will be introduced and analyzed. This will be done to address some of our issues with E3. Since there is no documentation, we conduct these experiments in an attempt to get more insight into how E3 works. This will not be done for Intel power Gadget, RAPL and LHM as no issues has been observed when creating the framework. Secondly, the configuration introduced in \cref{subsec:sql} needs some values for what ranges of battery percentages and temperatures are ideal for the experiment to run in.
