\section{Initial Experiments}

Before the experiments can be run, some initial experiments will be introduced and analyzed in thi section. These experiments will cover three issues, regarding first of all E3 where the documentation is not deemed sufficient. Intel power Gadget, RAPL and OpenHardwareMonitor all seemed to work as intended during the initial testing in this work, which E3 did not. Second of all, the configuration introduced in \cref{subsec:sql} needs some values for what ranges of battery percentages and temperatures are deemed ideal for the experiment to be run in. Lastly we have the idle energy consumption of the different systems, used to isolate the energy consumption of the test program.
