\section{Initial Experiments}\label{sec:initial_experiments}




In this section, some initial experiments will be introduced and analyzed. This will be done to address issues related to E3 as the documentation, where the documentation is not sufficient. This will not be done for Intel power Gadget, RAPL and LHM as no issues has been observed during the initial testing. Secondly, the configuration introduced in \cref{subsec:sql} needs some values for what ranges of battery percentages and temperatures are ideal for the experiment to run in.

% In this section, we will introduce and analyze some initial experiments that will address issues related to E3, where the documentation is lacking. We will also determine the ideal ranges of battery percentages and temperatures for the experiment, and measure the idle energy consumption of the different systems used. To begin, we will test Intel power Gadget, RAPL, and LHM to ensure they function as intended, with a focus on E3. Next, we will establish the optimal conditions for running the experiment, based on battery percentage and temperature. Finally, we will measure the idle energy consumption of the systems to isolate the energy consumption of the test case.
