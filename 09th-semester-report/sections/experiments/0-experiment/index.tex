\section{Initial Experiments}

Before the experiments can run some initial experiments will be introduced and analyzed in this section. These experiments will first of all cover three issues regarding E3, where the documentation is not sufficient. Intel power Gadget, RAPL and OpenHardwareMonitor all seemed to work as intended during the initial testing, but E3 did not. Second of all, the configuration introduced in \cref{subsec:sql} needs some values for what ranges of battery percentages and temperatures are ideal for the experiment to run in. Lastly, we have the idle energy consumption of the different systems used to isolate the energy consumption of the test program.
