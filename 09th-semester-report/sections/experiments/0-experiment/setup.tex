\subsection{Experiment Representation}\label[subsec]{subsec:exp_rep}

After the introduction to the framework in \cref{subsec:framework}, the format of the data in \cref{subsec:sql}, the different DUTs, test cases and measuring instruments in \cref{sec:hardware}, \cref{subsec:test_cases}, \cref{sec:measuring_instruments} respectively, the experiments can now be introduced. This will be done in the context of the different terms related to the experiments found in \cref{tab:TerminologyAlert}.

\paragraph{}
When running the experiments, it will be done based on different experiment configurations. These configurations will be different DUTs, test cases and measuring instruments. Here the same computer running either Windows or Linux will count as different DUTs. In the framework, a test case will run for a minimum period of time, before switching to the next configuration, and based on what was found in \cref{sec:E3Experiments}, this period will be one minute. In this period of one minute, the total energy consumption will be captured, in addition to how many times the test case was executed, which means an average energy consumption per test case run can be calculated. After this one minute of execution, there is an optional cooldown period, not used in the initial experiments. This was chosen as no argument could be found for this value, and no effect of this was expected.

During one minute, the test case will execute $n$ times, resulting in $n$ samples, according to \cref{tab:TerminologyAlert}. When the test case has been executed for one minute, this will be called a measurement. When the same configuration has been executed multiple times, it is a test case measurement according to \cref{tab:TerminologyAlert}.

\paragraph*{}
As was introduced in \cref{subsec:cock}, Cochran's formula will be used to calculate how many measurements are required, in order for the results to be within some pre-defined standard deviation. Before this value is chosen, an arbitrary value of 120 is used. In addition to this, a value is also needed for how many measurements $m$ should be made for each measuring instrument between restarts. On start up, one test case is chosen to be executed until the next restart. For this test case, each measuring instrument needs to make $m$ measurement before the DUT restarts. This is done to ensure there will be multiple measurements where the test is run for the $1 \dots m$'th time after a restart. Here $m=30$ was chosen, as this would mean each run after a restart, would have four measurements. If based on Cochran's formula the values are not deemed sufficient, additional experiments will be executed.

 %for each $m$ times a test case is executed after a restart.

%For this test case, we need to take $m$ measurements with each instrument before the device under test (DUT) is restarted. This is to ensure that there are multiple measurements for each run after a restart. We chose $m=30$ so that each run after a restart would have four measurements. If the sample size is not large enough according to Cochran's formula, we will conduct additional experiments.

\paragraph*{}
In addition to this, R3 validation\cite*[]{Bokhari2020r3} will also be utilized in an adapted manner. The idea from the original article was to compare different implementations of the same test case, to see which version performed best. The idea was to switch between which implementation was the first to run after a restart, to make the comparison fairer. In our work, it is a bit different, where different measuring instruments will be compared. When running the experiment, with three measuring instruments $A, B$ and $C$ and test cast $T$ and DUT $D$, $D$ will execute $T$ multiple times in a row. The first time $A$ will measure the energy consumption, then $B$ etc. When $D$ has reached a state where it needs to restart, it will save which measuring instrument was used first. When $D$ has restarted, it will again execute $T$, but this time $B$ will measure first, then $C$ and $A$ at last. This will continue until the measuring instruments have 120 measurements each.
