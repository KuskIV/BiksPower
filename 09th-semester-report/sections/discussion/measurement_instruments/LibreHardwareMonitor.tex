One issue with LHM is the sampling rate. It was found in \cref{sec:rw_key_takeaways} that using the same sampling rate for the measuring instruments is beneficial when attempting to compare them. However during some initial testing with LHM it was found that using a sampling rate of more than 2 Hz would frequently produce errors. Therefore a frequency of 2 Hz is used during the experiments with LHM, whereas the other measuring instruments use a frequency of 10 Hz. A decision was made to not limit the other measuring instruments to the maximum frequency of LHM and instead accept that is an disadvantage with LHM.
