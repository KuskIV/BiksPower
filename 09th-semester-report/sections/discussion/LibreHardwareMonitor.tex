\subsection{Open / Libre Hardware Monitor}
One issue with Libre Hardware Monitor is the sampling rate. It was found in \cref{sec:rw_key_takeaways} that using the same sampling rate for the measuring instruments is beneficial when attempting to compare them. However during some initial testing with Libre Hardware Monitor it was found that using a sampling rate of more than 2 Hz would frequently produce errors. Therefore a frequency of 2 Hz is used during the experiments with Libre Hardware Monitor, whereas the other measuring instruments use a frequency of 10 Hz. A decision was made to not limit the other measuring instruments to the maximum frequency of Libre Hardware Monitor and instead accept that is an disadvantage with Libre Hardware Monitor.
