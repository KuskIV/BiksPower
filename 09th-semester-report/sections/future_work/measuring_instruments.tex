\section{Measuring Instruments}

When considering the measuring instruments, two things can be considered. This is first of all regarding adding new measuring instruments, or more in-depth analysis of the ones included in our work.

\paragraph*{}
When considering adding new measuring instruments, one promising one was brought to our attention by our supervisors. This measuring instrument is a Windows implementation of RAPL\feetnote{https://github.com/hubblo-org/windows-rapl-driver}, which to our knowledge is yet to be subject of an analysis of the accuracy of its measurements.

\paragraph*{}
When considering additional experiments on the measuring instruments included in our work, a few was mentioned in \cref{ch:discussion}. This could first of all be with regards to E3s ability to measure and isolate the energy consumption of a test case, when some workload is running the background. An experiment could also be to look at the effect the charger, by measuring the energy consumption of test cases, when the DUT is charging compared to when it is not. In the work by Khan et al.\cite[]{RAPL_in_action}, an analysis of the overhead of RAPL was conducted, by pinning the test case and framework to the same core of the CPU. Here the overhead of RAPL is found to be less than $2\%$, where a similar analysis of the other measuring instruments could be interesting.
