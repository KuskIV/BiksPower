\section{Test Cases}

In this work, four test cases are included from the Computer Language Benchmark Game. Based on the results, it was difficult to find a pattern with regards to which measuring instruments always measured highest, seconds highest, ect. This could mean the different measuring instruments perform differently when considering different workloads or operations. Because of this, it could be interesting to include more test cases. This could be a combination of more test cases from the Computer Language Benchmark Game, larger applications representing a real life application or test case only performing a single operation.

\paragraph*{}
This work only considers C\#, where the test cases chosen for a future work, could include some additional languages. This could be used to extend the analysis if the different measuring instruments performs best in certain cases.
