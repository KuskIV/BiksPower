\section{Hardware}

The hardware chosen in this work, included three different DUTs with two surface devices and one workstation. Both Surface devices are from 2015, where the CPU from the workstation was released in 2017. To get a better understanding of how the hardware effects the results it could be interesting to include some additional hardware. This could include both newer and older hardware, to see if some measuring instruments works better or worse on different versions of hardware. It could also be very interesting to get a hardware measuring on a DUT with a battery, in order to compare E3 against it. In the current state of this work, it is difficult to say anything about how accurate E3 is compared to IPG, RAPL and LHM. The hardware measurements could be obtained either by measuring the DC energy consumption directly on the CPU, or by removing the battery, and thus using the clamp on the charger.

The idea of including DC measuring into the experiments could also be interesting on the workstation, as this would mean measurements would only include the energy consumption from the CPU, and not other components of the DUT.
