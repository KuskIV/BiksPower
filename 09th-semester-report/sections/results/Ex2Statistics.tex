\subsection{Statistical analysis of experiment 2}
In this section the analysis of the results from experiment 2 will be conducted. Firstly the normal distribution for experiment 2 will be analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. 

The expectations is that the distribution wil not be normally distributed, this is because experiment 1 was not always normally distributed, we would not expected this experiment to differ much in that aspects. 

\input{tabels/experiment_results/exp_two/StatQuest/NormDist.tex} 

As can be seen in \cref{tab:NormDist2}, the data is not normally distributed the data from experiment 2 is generally further away from being normally distributed than the experiment 1. This is not that surprising given that experiment 2 contain less actual runs as these were not needed as found in \cref{subsec:CockUse}. 

For the MannWhitney U test we would again expect very similar results to the results from experiment one, where the null hypotheses can be rejected in most of the cases.
The results from the MannWhitney U test can be seen here in \cref{tab:HeatFannkuchRedux2}.
\input{tabels/experiment_results/exp_two/StatQuest/MannWhitFann.tex}
The shown table in \cref{tab:HeatFannkuchRedux2}, is again from the FannkuchRedux Test Case as in \cref{subsec:Stat1}. Again we see a similar tendency in that for most cases we can reject $H_0$, but for experiment 2 there are a few more cases where we cannot reject $H_0$. Once possible reason why that might be the case is that there are fewer samples in experiment 2 so outlier have a larger effect on the Ex1Statistics.

Finally for the Correlations between the measuring instruments, which can be seen in 
\input{tabels/experiment_results/exp_two/StatQuest/CorrelationPower.tex}
