\section{Disabled C-States}

Next, up, experiment \#2 will be covered, where the DUT was in performance mode. This was done to attempt to get a more realistic idle case, resulting in a more realistic dynamic energy consumption of the other test cases.

\paragraph*{Expectations:} The expectation for this experiment, is a higher energy consumption on all test cases, especially the idle test case. This increased energy consumption for the test cases will most likely result in a decreased dynamic energy consumption, as we expect the energy consumption for the idle test case to increase more than the other test cases.

\paragraph*{Result:} When considering the result, the test case BinaryTrees can be seen in \cref{fig:BinaryTrees_Cores_comparison_dynamic_energy_without_outliers_avg_watts_exp2}, and for the other test cases in \cref{app:exp_two}.
