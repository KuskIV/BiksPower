\section{Energy Profilers}\label{sec:energy_profilers}

When considering \textbf{RQ2}, different energy profilers are needed. In this section different existing approached will be presented, and in the end compared.

When selecting the profilers, promising ones were chosen in different categories, including software manufactures, hardware manufacture and at last open source. When considering hardware manufactures, Intel's RAPL and Power Gadget were chosen as their solutions with potential for hardware support could be promising. For software manufactures, Microsoft's E3 was chosen as their domain knowledge could prove valuable for a good energy estimation. Lastly, an open source project is included, this being Open Hardware Monitor, to see how this compared to three, potentially more sophisticated solutions. All the different profilers will be introduced now.
