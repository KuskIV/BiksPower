\section{Microsoft energy estimation engine}
Microsoft estimation energy estimation engine(E3), is a tool created to monitor battery usage on windows devices, because of this it is only available on windows devices with battery's. E3 monitors the computer at all times to created battery energy usage reports, 

that can be accessed in the power battery settings under Battery usage \cite[p.43]{E3WinHec}. The reported accuracy of E3 varies based on certain factors specifically if a specifically made energy measurement chip is build into the computer. The reported accuracies for each part can be seen in \cref{tab:E3_acc_Table}.

It can be seen that there seems to be large differences in the accuracy between devices with and without the chip. The chips refereed to here are specifically the Maxim MAX34407 and the Maxim MAX34417, finding the models of computers that actually contain these chips have proven difficult. 

E3 differs from other tools with similar functionality in that it creates estimates for each program running on the machine individually. Most tools will instead provide some energy usage estimate in a giving time span. 

The reports created by E3 will by default contain logs of power usage for the previous $7$ days, where each program and their power usage is logged. Each log entry accounts for $1-5$ minutes depending on the actual length of the program execution \cite[]{E3Video}. Each entry of the reported power contains the following attributes:
