\subsection*{Microsoft energy estimation engine}
Microsoft estimation energy estimation engine(E3), is a tool created to monitor battery usage on windows devices, because of this it is only available on windows devices with battery's. E3 monitors the computer at all times to created battery energy usage reports, that can be accessed in the power battery settings under Battery usage\cite[p.43]{E3WinHec}. The reported accuracy of E3 varies based on certain factors specifically if a specifically made energy measurement chip is build into the computer. The reported accuracies for each part can be seen in table \cref{E3Table}.

It can be seen that there seems to be large differences in the accuracy between devices with and without the chip. The chips refereed to here are specifically the Maxim MAX34407 and the Maxim MAX34417, finding the models of computers that actually contain these chips have proven difficult.
