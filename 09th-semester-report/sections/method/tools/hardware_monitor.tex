\subsection{Hardware Monitor}

Open Hardware Monitor is a free open source piece of software able to monitor metrics like temperature, fan speeds, voltages, loads and clock speeds on a computer for both CPU and GPU. According to the documentation, does the software support most hardware monitoring chips on motherboards, and works for both Intel and AMD chips, in addition to both 32bit and 64bit windows, and any x86 based Linux. When running, the software will publish all data to the WIndows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which allows other applications to use the data.\cite[]{open_hardware_monitor}
