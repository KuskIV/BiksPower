\section{Hardware}\label{sec:hardware}

When measuring the energy consumption of hardware, different software-based measuring instruments were introduced in \cref{sec:measuring_instruments}. In this section the hardware of the DUT's which these tools will measure the energy consumption on will be introduced. This will include an analysis of the different requirements the tools had, in order to find which combination of hardware will give the best result.
