\paragraph*{Raspberry Pi 4:}
The Raspberry Pi 4\cite{RaspberryPi4} is the fourth iteration of the popular single-board computer. The Raspberry Pi runs an OS called Raspbian which is an adapted version of the Debian Linux OS. Raspbian is a 32-bit operating system and the Raspberry Pi 4 has a 64-bit ARM CPU.\cite{RaspberryPi4} Because of the portability of the WaveForm software, it is possible to install it on the Raspberry Pi making it a dedicated measuring tool for energy consumption. Since the Raspberry Pi 4 can access the internet, it can process the measurements and upload the results as needed. With the scripting available for the WaveForm software it is possible to make a fully automatic measuring setup. Given these properties, a Raspberry Pi 4 will be used as the system starting, stopping, and processing data from the clamp.
