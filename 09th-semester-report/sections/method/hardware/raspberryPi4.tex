\paragraph*{Raspberry Pi 4}
The Raspberry Pi 4 is the fourth iteration of the popular single board computer mainly intended for smaller hobby projects. The Raspberry Pi run a special version of the operating system called Raspbian which is an adapted version of the The Debian linux OS. Raspbian is 32-bit operating system overthought the Raspberry Pi 4 has a 63-bit arm cpu. Because of the portability of the WaveForm software it is possible to install it on the Raspberry pi making it a dedicated measuring tool for energy consumption. Since the Raspberry pi 4 can access the internet it can take the measurements, process and  upload the results them as needed. This together with the scripting available for the WaveForm software it is possible to make a fully automatic measuring setup that can run 24/7. The automatic measuring makes it possible to conduct many more experiments and process much more data than would otherwise have been achievable.
