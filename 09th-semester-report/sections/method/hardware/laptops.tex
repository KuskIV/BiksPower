\subsection{DUTs}\label[subsec]{subsec:DUTs}

Following the introduction to what kind of DUT's are required for this work in \cref{subsec:setup}, this section will introduce the choosen DUT's. Before going into depth with each DUT, some overall comments can be made. The first thing is in regards to the operating systems, where each DUT has the same version of both Windows and Linux. The specific versions was chosen based on what the most recent update when the experiments were executed in November 2022. Each DUT were in addition to this running on a fresh install of each operating system, to limit unneccesary background processes.

\paragraph{Surface Book:} The first DUT was the Surface Book, first released in October in 2015, where the specifications can be seen in \cref{tab:surfaceBook}. This was to most difficult DUT to find, as this is the one with a MAXMIM chip. The reason why this DUT was difficult to find, was because the MAXIM chip is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation for this Surface Book, or any newer versions of it.
