\subsection{Setup}

As was covered in \cref*{sec:measuring_instruments}, four different measuring instruments were chosen, based on different criteria. Because these measuring instruments require different operating systems, the setup will first of all be for both Windows and Linux. In addition to this, E3 has some specific demands, where claims were made regarding under what circumstances it would perform best. The first demand was regarding a DUT with a battery, and a DUT with the special MAXIM chip. Because of this, three different DUTs were choosen, to test all these cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A DUT with a battery and a MAXIM chip
    \item A DUT with a battery and no MAXIM chip
    \item A DUT with no battery and no maxim chip
\end{itemize}

In addition to this, E3 also claimed to work best when the charger is disabled, and smart plugs is required for this. In order to compare the performance of the different software measurement instruments, a hardware solution is also required. This hardware solution should be able to log to a computer, where the computer should be able to turn it on an off when the experiments are running.\todo[]{Create drawing showing this}
