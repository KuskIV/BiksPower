\paragraph*{CloudFree EU smart Plugs}
The plugs are used to toggle the charging of the laptops for the experiments. The Plugs used are specifically the CloudFree EU smart Plugs. The Plugs are using the open source firmware TASMOTA\cite{TomatoGit}, which enables control via http requests directly to the plug. The plugs also have power measurement capabilities, but the exact accuracies of these are not reported anywhere on CloudFrees homepage, and will not be subject to testing in this project. The plug can sustain a electrical load of 3680 watts which is more than enough for the laptops used in these experiments.
