\paragraph*{CloudFree EU smart Plugs}

When running the experiments, two CloudFee EU Smart Plugs were aquired, to enable and disable the chargers of the two laptops used in this study. This is done as the as the E3 energy measurement instrument claims to work best when the DUT is not charging when it is measuring the energy consumption, as was covered in \cref{subsec:e3}. The Plugs are using the open source firmware TASMOTA\cite{TomatoGit}, which enables control via \texttt{http} requests directly to the plug, and not through a third party app. The plugs also have power measurement capabilities, but the exact accuracies of these are not reported anywhere on CloudFrees homepage, and will not be subject to testing in this work. The plug can sustain a electrical load of 3680 watts which is more than enough for the laptops used in these experiments.
