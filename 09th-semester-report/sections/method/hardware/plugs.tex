\paragraph*{CloudFree EU smart Plugs}

When running the experiments, two CloudFree EU Smart Plugs\cite{CloudFreeEUSMartPlug} were acquired, to enable and disable the chargers of the two laptops used. This is done as it is claimed that E3  works best when the DUT is not charging while it is measuring the energy consumption, as was covered in \cref{subsec:e3}. The Plugs are using the open-source firmware TASMOTA\cite{TomatoGit}, which enables control via \texttt{http} requests directly to the plug, avoiding any third-party applications. The plugs also have power measurement capabilities, but the exact accuracies of these are not reported anywhere on the CloudFree website, and will not be subject to testing in this work. The plug can sustain an electrical load of 3680 watts which is more than enough for the laptops used in these experiments.\cite{CloudFreeEUSMartPlug}
