\paragraph*{AC Current clamp MN60}
The current clamp was briefly covered in the \cref{sec:clampIntro}, with some important specification of the version of the device that is used, such as its high reported accuracy and the potentially high sampling rate. 
The current clamp can measure the current passing trough the phase of a wire, which can then be used to derive the joule passing trough it. The benefits from using a current clamp as opposed to other methods of probing is that there is no exposed wiring that could accidentally be interacted with, this was a priority as mains voltage can be lethal and direct measurements could come with some risk. Though this added safety does come with certain drawbacks, current clamps are less accurate than more direct ways of measuring the power when looking at a price to accuracy ration. Another limitation with the current clamp versus other measurement equipment is that it alone cannot measure anything and needs an oscilloscope to function.
