\paragraph*{AC Current clamp MN60}


The current clamp used and some of the specifications like the accuracy and the potentially hight sample rate was briefly covered in \cref{sec:clampIntro}.
The current clamp can measure the current passing trough the phase of a wire, which can be used to derive the joule passing trough it. The benefits of using a current clamp as opposed to other methods, is that there is not exposed wiring that could accidentally be interacted with. This was a priority as mains voltage can be lethal and direct measurements could come with some risk. Though this added safety does come with certain drawbacks, current clamps are less accurate than more direct ways of measuring the power when looking at a price to accuracy ration\todo[]{source on this, and also, isn't this irrelevant?}. Another limitation with the current clamp compared to for example the WattsUpMeter is that an oscilloscope is required to read the output from the clamp.
