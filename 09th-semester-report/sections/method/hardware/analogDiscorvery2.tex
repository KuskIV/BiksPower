\paragraph*{Analog Discovery 2:}\label{par:AnalDisc2}
The Analog Discovery 2 created by Digilent\cite{AnalogDiscovery2} is an electronics multitool that can be connected to any computer via USB and controlled using the proprietary software WaveForm. The Analog Discovery 2 has multiple uses for example it can be used as a Logic analyzer, a variable power supply, and an oscilloscope among other things as described in\cite{AnalogDoc}. An advantage of the Analog Discovery 2 over other oscilloscopes is that it is made to be controlled via a computer, which makes it much easier to log measurements directly from the clamp, as opposed to a traditional oscilloscope. Using a scripting language provided through WaveForm, it is possible to automate interactions between the clamp and Analog Discovery 2. This makes it possible to automate when the measurements should be saved. The measurements will through the Analog Discovery 2 have a frequency of 10Hz. This enables easy and continuous measurements and logging. The WaveForm software has thorough documentation regarding the best practices of how to use the software, making it easy to measure the energy consumption of the DUT without a battery. WaveForm is available for both X86 and ARM, 32-bit and 64-bit chips for Mac, Linux, and Windows making it platform portable.\cite{AnalogDoc}
