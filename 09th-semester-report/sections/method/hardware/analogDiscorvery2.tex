\paragraph*{Analog Discovery 2}\label{par:AnalDisc2}
The Analog Discovery 2 created by Digilent\cite{AnalogDiscovery2} is an electronics multitool which can be connected to any computer via USB and controlled using the proprietary software WaveForm. The Analog Discovery 2 can both be used as a Logic analyzer, a variable power supply, an oscilloscope and much more\cite{AnalogDoc}. One advantage of the Analog Discovery 2 over other oscilloscopes is that it is made to be controlled via a computer, which makes it much easier to log measurements directly from the device, as opposed to a traditional oscilloscope. The WaveForm even provides a limited scripting language to control and interact with the device automatically. Connecting the MN60 current clamp to the Analog Discovery 2 makes it possible to take measurements of the power consumption of the system with a frequency of 10Hz. This enables easy and continuous measurements and logging. The WaveForm software has good and thorough documentation regarding the best practices of how to use the software, making it easy to measure the energy consumption of the different DUTs. The software is available for both X86 and ARM, 32-bit and 64-bit chips for Mac, Linux and Windows making it extremely platform portable.\cite{AnalogDoc}
