\paragraph*{Analog Discovery 2}\label{par:AnalDisc2}
The Analog Discovery 2 created by Digilent\cite{AnalogDiscovery2} is an electronics multitool which can be connected to any computer via USB and controlled using the proprietary software WaveForm. The Analog Discovery 2 can both be used as a Logic analyzer, a variable power supply, an oscilloscope and much more\cite{AnalogDoc}. An advantage of the Analog Discovery 2 over other oscilloscopes is that it is made to be controlled via a computer, which makes it much easier to log measurements directly from the clamp, as opposed to a traditional oscilloscope. Using a scripting language provided through WaveForm, it is possible to automate interactions between the clamp adn Analog Discovery 2. This makes it possible to automate when the measurements should be saved. The measurements will through the Analog Discovery 2 have a frequency of 10Hz\todo[]{A must have was a frequency of 1hz}. This enables easy and continuous measurements and logging. The WaveForm software has good and thorough documentation regarding the best practices of how to use the software, making it easy to measure the energy consumption of the DUT without a battery. WaveForm is available for both X86 and ARM, 32-bit and 64-bit chips for Mac, Linux and Windows making it extremely platform portable.\cite{AnalogDoc}
