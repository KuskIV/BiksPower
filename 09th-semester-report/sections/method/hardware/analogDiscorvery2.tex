\paragraph*{Analog Discovery 2}
The Analog Discovery 2 is a electronics multitool which can be connected to any computer via usb and controlled using the the proprietary software WaveForm. Both the Analog Discovery 2 and WaveForm are both developed and produced by the company Digilent. The Analog Discovery 2 can both be used as an Logic analyzer, a variable power supply, a oscilloscope and much more\cite{AnalogDoc}. What really sets the Analog Discovery 2 apart from using a normal oscilloscope is that it is made to be controlled via a computer making it much easier to log measurements directly from the device, as opposed to a traditional oscilloscope. The WaveForm even provides a limited scripting language to control and interacted with the device automatically. Connecting the MN60 current clamp to the Analog Discovery 2 made it possible to take 10 Hz measurement of the power consumption of the system. This enabled easy and continues measurements and logging. The WaveForm software has good and thorough documentation in the usage of the software making it easy to make the measurement's. The software is available for both X86 and arm, 32bit and 64bits chips for Mac, Linux and Windows making it extremely platform portable.
