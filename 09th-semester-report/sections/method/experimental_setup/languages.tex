\subsection{Languages}\label[subsec]{subsec:language}

When considering what languages to use in the implementation of the test cases, different approaches have been seen. One such approach is from the work by Pereira et al.\cite{Pereira2017}, where 27 different languages were chosen, to compare the energy consumption of similar implementations in different languages. The aim in this work is however a bit different, where instead measuring instruments are compared, as is mentioned in \textbf{RQ2}. Because of this, the specific language is not expected to make a huge difference, which is why C\# is chosen, as this is the preferred language of the authors. When publishing both test cases and the framework presented in \cref*{subsec:framework} it will be done to a folder, with the default settings seen in \cref*{tab:vs_settings}.
