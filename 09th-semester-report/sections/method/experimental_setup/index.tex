\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experimental_setup}

After the introduction to the measurement instruments and hardware in \cref{sec:measuring_instruments} and \cref{sec:hardware} respectively, the experimental setup will be introduced. This will first of all be with regards to the test cases considering both language and implementation.

\paragraph*{}
Another thing considered regarding how the experiments will be conducted, how the energy consumption of the test cases will be measured and how it will be saved.
