\subsection{Test Cases}

After the language has been decided, another thing to consider is which test cases make sense to run during the experiments. Based on what was found in \cref{ch:related_work}, two common repositories are used, either Rosetta Code\cite[]{rosetta_code} or the Computer Language Benchmark Game\cite[]{benchmark_game}. Here different benchmarks are chosen with different sizes and loads on different parts of the DUT. In the end, the choices were made based on the work by Lima et al.\cite[]{greenland2016statistical} and Koedijk et al.\cite[]{Koedijk2022diff}, where the benchmarks tested either the CPU, memory, synchronization, IO or disk. The choices for the experiments conducted in this work can be seen in \cref{tab:benchmarks}. When choosing the specific implementation of each test case, it was done based on speed, where the fastest was choosen for the newest version of C\#. Unsafe solutions were also disregarded, as we consider the other implementations to be more realistic.
