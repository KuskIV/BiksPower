\subsection{Open Hardware Monitor / Libre Hardware Monitor}\label[subsec]{subsec:HardwareMonitor}
Open Hardware Monitor is a free open-source piece of software able to monitor metrics like temperature, fan speeds, voltages, loads and clock speeds on a computer for both CPU and GPU. According to the documentation, the software supports most hardware monitoring chips on motherboards and works for both Intel and AMD chips, in addition to both 32bit and 64bit windows, and any x86-based Linux. When running, the software will publish all data to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), which allows other applications to use the data.\cite[]{open_hardware_monitor}

This tool is not mentioned in any articles, and accuracy is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation. Generally, the information in the literature and its documentation pertaining to accuracy are either very sparse on non-existent. A fork of Open Hardware Monitor called Libre Hardware Monitor (LHM) is available on Github\cite{libre_hardware_monitor}. From here a version without a GUI is used to minimize the energy consumption from the measuring instrument itself.
