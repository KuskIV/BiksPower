\section{Measuring Instruments}\label{sec:measuring_instruments}

When considering \textbf{RQ2}, different measuring instruments are needed. In this section, different existing approaches will be presented, and then compared.

When selecting software-based measuring instruments there are several options which are chosen from different categories, including software manufacturers, hardware manufacture and open source. From the hardware manufacturers, Intel's RAPL and Intel's Power Gadget were chosen as their solutions with potential for hardware support could be promising. For software manufacturers, Microsoft's E3 was chosen as their domain knowledge could prove valuable for energy estimation. Lastly, an open source project is included, this being Open Hardware Monitor, to see how this compared to three, potentially more sophisticated solutions. All the different software-based measuring instruments will be introduced now.
