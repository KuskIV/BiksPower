\subsection{Hardware current measurements} \label[]{clampIntro}
This section will cover what tool is used to conduct hardware measurements and how to use it. For the measurement a AC current clamp was used specifically the MN60 created by Chauvin Arnoux. The current clamp is an analog device meaning it does not use digital signal, but instead output an analog signal. To read the signal the current clamp has the be connected to an oscilloscope, and the clamp itself connected to the electrical phase of the wire leading into the power supply for the computer. An illustration of the proposed usage of the current clamp together with an oscilloscope can be seen in \cref{fig:clampSetup}

The output from the current is in mv that then has a specific conversion rate to a current root mean square value which together with the socket specification, this being 230 volts in the EU, can be used to calculate the exact amount of joules flowing trough the wire at any point in time. The sampling frequency of the current clamps is depended on the oscilloscope used, the accuracies of the clamp is claimed to by $<1\%$ \cite{ClampDoc}, which is within the expected range for hardware measurements used in other studies such as the Watts up pro with an accuracy of $<1.5\%$, but our setups potential in terms of measurement frequency.
