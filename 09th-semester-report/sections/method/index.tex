\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

Based on the knowledge gathered through \cref{ch:related_work}, this chapter will introduce the different components used for the experiments of our work. This will, first of all, be regarding the measuring instruments and DUTs used, which are presented in \cref{sec:measuring_instruments} and \cref{sec:hardware} respectively. In \cref{sec:experimental_setup}, the experimental setup will be introduced. This will be concerning the test cases, measurement methodology, framework, and database. Lastly, \cref{sec:stat} uncovers how the measurements become comparable, as mentioned in \textbf{RQ1}.
