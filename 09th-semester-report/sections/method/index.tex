\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

Based on the knowledge gathered through \cref*{ch:related_work}, this chapter will introduce the experiments of this work. This will first of all be regarding the measurement instruments and DUT's used in this work, presented in \cref*{sec:measuring_instruments} and \cref*{sec:hardware} respectively. In \cref*{sec:experimental_setup}, where the experimental setup will be introduced. This will be with respect to test cases, measurement methodology, the framework and the database. Lastly, \cref*{sec:stat} uncovers how the measurements become comparable, as mentioned in \textbf{RQ1}.
