\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

Following the introduction to this work, it is now time to take a further look into how the research questions can be answered. This will be achieved by looking at the different components required in the experiments, to find the best fit. This will first of all be the measuring instruments in \cref{sec:measuring_instruments}, hardware in \cref{sec:hardware}, how the data is saved in \cref{sec:save_data} and statistical methods in \cref{sec:stat}.
