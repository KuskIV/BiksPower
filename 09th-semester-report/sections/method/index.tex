\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

Following the introduction to this work, it is now time to take a further look into how the research questions can be answered. This will be achieved by looking at the different components required in the experiments, in order to find the best fit.

\section{Measuring Software}\label{sec:measuring_software}

When considering research question one, different ways of measuring the energy consumption is needed. In this section different existing approached will be presented, and in the end compared.

\section{Hardware}\label{sec:hardware}

When measuring the energy consumption of hardware, different software measuring tools were introduced in \cref{sec:measuring_software}. In this section the hardware these tools will measure the energy consumption on will be introduced. This will include an analysis of the different requirements the tools had, in order to find which combination of hardware will give the best result.

\section{Metrics}\label{sec:metrics}

As this work will aim to compare different ways to measure the energy consumption of software, not only across different measuring approaches, but also different hardware and operating systems, a way to represent the data is required. In this section different ways to make the data presentable and comparable will be presented.

\section{Experimental Approach}\label{sec:experimental_approach}

After the different components required in order to execute the experiment has been introduced, it is not time to take a deeper look into the experiment. This will be in regards to the languages used, how the data is saved, how many times the experiments are run ect.
