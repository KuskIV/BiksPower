\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

Following the introduction to this work, it is now time to take a further look into how the research questions can be answered. This will be achieved by looking at the different components required in the experiments, in order to find the best fit. This will first of all be energy profilers in \cref*{sec:energy_profilers}, hardware in \cref*{sec:hardware}, how the data is saved in \cref*{sec:save_data}  and statistical methods in \cref*{sec:stat}
