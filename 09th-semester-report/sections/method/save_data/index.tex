\section{How to Save the Data}\label{sec:save_data}

When measuring the energy consumption, the results needs to be saved somewhere, for later analysis. The data should therefore be saved in a structured way, where it can be easily accessed later. Another point is that the data should be collected in one place, despite coming from multiple computers, and lastly during the experiments, the solution should consume no power. For this, and SQL database was chosen. This will be discovered further now.
