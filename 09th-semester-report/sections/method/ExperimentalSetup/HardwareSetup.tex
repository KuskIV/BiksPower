\subsection{Measurement Methodology}
When conducting the experiments three different kinds of measuring approach are being utilized from the tools in \cref{sec:hardware}.
The hardware measurements are system-level physical measurements, while RAPL, OpenHardwareMonitor and sometimes E3 are measurement using on-chip sensor's. The final approach are Energy predictive models with are E3, when the power meter chip is not available. The most accurate of these is the system-level physical measurement which can provide highly accurate measurements for the systems energy consumption, but these measurements are for the system, so it cannot provide a fine grained view of an applications power consumption.
