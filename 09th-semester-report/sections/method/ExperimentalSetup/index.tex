\section{Measurement Methodology}\label{sec:Measurement_Methodology}

Now that the different hardware required to execute the experiment have been introduced, the following section will delve into the measurement methodology. When conducting the experiments three different kinds of measuring approaches are being utilized from the tools in \cref{sec:hardware}. In the following sections the framework is described as well as the test cases on which the measurements are done.


%A framework to runTo solve these issues and accommodate an  dynamic energy consumption can solve this, which is expanded upon in \cref{sec:rw_measureing_methodology_setup}
