\subsection{Anomalies}
Anomaly detection is important when using the data as i will influence the results from the experiments. When an anomaly is detected it will be removed from teh data as to not corrupt the rest of teh results.
\paragraph{DBScan}
To find and remove these anomalies the DBScan algorithm will be used. The DBScan algorithm is essentials a clustering algorithm that is used to cluster data into groups, but is can also be used for density based abnormality detection.
