\section{Statistical methods}\label{sec:stat}

As this work will aim to compare different measuring instruments, but also different hardware and operating systems, a way to represent the data is required. In this section different ways to make the data presentable and comparable will be presented. The selection of the various statistical methods is partly inspired by Koedijk et al.\cite{Koedijk2022diff} and Fahad et al.\cite{fahad2019comparative}.
