\section{Statistical methods}\label{sec:stat}

As this work will aim to compare different ways to measure the energy consumption of software, not only across different measuring approaches, but also different hardware and operating systems, a way to represent the data is required. In this section different ways to make the data presentable and comparable will be presented. The selection of the varies statical methods are in partly inspired by Koedijk et al\cite{koedijk2022finding} and Fahad et al \cite{fahad2019comparative}.
