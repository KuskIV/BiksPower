\section{Statistical methods}\label{sec:stat}

In order to answer the second part of \textbf{RQ1} which is about making measurements comparable, this section will aim to introduce different statistical models able to do this. The selection of the various statistical methods is partly inspired by Koedijk et al.\cite{Koedijk2022diff} and Fahad et al.\cite{fahad2019comparative}.
