\section{Statistical methods}\label{sec:stat}

As this work will aim to compare different measuring instruments as well as a variety of hardware and OSes, a way to represent the data is required. In this section, different ways statistical methods to make the data presentable and comparable will be presented. The selection of the various statistical methods is partly inspired by Koedijk et al.\cite{Koedijk2022diff} and Fahad et al.\cite{fahad2019comparative}.
