% How to measure the energy consumption of code

\section{Measure Energy Consumption of Code}

When measuring the energy consumption of a process, different energy profilers exists which has been used in existing work. One popular approach are model-based power consumption estimators provided by x86 microprocessors, including Intel's RAPL for intel chips, and Application Power Management (APM) for AMD.

\todo{I think this sentence is weird.}Work exists for RAPL, here it is deemed a viable alternative to physical measurements, where it consistently under-estimates\cite[]{Dongarra2012, Hackenberg2013}, but it does have some limitations, as RAPL values are not physical measurements, it is rather based on modeling approach\cite[]{Hackenberg2013}. Another limitation is how RAPL returns energy data and not power data. Because of this, the average update interval is used as timestamps for each update, and this value is assumed to be accurate enough.\cite[]{Hackenberg2013}

When considering APM, it is reasonably accurate, but suffers from for example systematic inaccuracies most likely caused by novelty of the interface.\cite[]{Hackenberg2013}


When measuring the energy consumption using hardware, it can be done on either AC or DC. When measuring AC, the measuring device is located between the power supply and the electrical outlet, and for DC it is from the power supply to the system.\cite[]{Hackenberg2013} Another hardware approach could also be using the Watts Up Pro power consumption meter, also used in multiple works as it has a very high accuracy of $1.5\%$.\cite[]{Jagroep2015}

%% FEETINGS: Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve Environmental Goal of the Software:

Mancebo et al. found that there are three types of problem that occur in the domain if evaluating software's energy consumption.\cite{MANCEBO2021100558} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first is that there are inconsistencies in the terminology, with different terms being used for the same concept or even the same term being used for different concepts. This lack of consistency hurts the understanding of the subject.
    \item The second problem is that there is no agreed upon methodology, which makes it difficult to compare and replicate results.
    \item Choosing the correct measuring instruments that are fitting for the particular experiment evaluation.
\end{enumerate}

To solve these problem a they created \textit{Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve Environmental Goals of the Software}(FEETINGS). FEETINGS consist of three main component which aim to solve these issues these are the Conceptual component, Methodological component and Technological component.\nytafsnit

The Conceptual component provides an extension of the the work by Garcia et al. which defines Software Measurement Ontology\cite{GARCIA2006631}. This extension is called Green Software Measurement Ontology (GSMO). It provides terminology and the corresponding definitions. The extended terminology from Mancebo et al. can be seen in \cref{tab:feetTable} along with extensions from other work and new extensions useful for this report.
