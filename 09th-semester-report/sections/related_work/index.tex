\chapter{Related Work}\label{ch:related_work}

The first step is to take a look at existing work. This will be done to gain inspiration, and in order to find shortcomings to avoid. This will be achieved in \cref*{sec:similar_work}, where already existing work aiming to achieve similar goals as this work does. In \cref*{sec:measure_energy} different approaches to measure the energy consumption used in other studies will be explored, and lastly \cref*{sec:experimental_setup} will cover how existing work has setup their respective benchmarks.
