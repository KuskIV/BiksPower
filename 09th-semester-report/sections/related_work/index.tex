\chapter{Related Work}\label{ch:related_work}

In this chapter, a look into existing work will be made. This is done to gain inspiration in already existing work and to find potential shortcomings to avoid. In \cref{sec:rw_energy_consumption_diff_lang}, existing work concerning the energy consumption of software is presented. Thereafter, different approaches to measuring the energy consumption of software, used in existing work will be explored in \cref{sec:rw_diff_measuring_instruments}. This is done to answers regarding which measuring instruments exists, which ones are considered state of the art ect. to decide which should be used in this work. In \cref{sec:rw_measureing_methodology_setup} different works discussing measuring methodology and benchmarks setups will be covered. Finally, in \cref{sec:rw_key_takeaways} the key aspects from the previous sections which are considered in this work are summarized.
