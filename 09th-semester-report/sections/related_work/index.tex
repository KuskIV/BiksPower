\chapter{Related Work}\label{ch:related_work}

The first step is to take a look at existing work. This is to gain inspiration and to find potential shortcomings to avoid. This is achieved in the following sections. In \cref*{sec:rw_energy_consumption_diff_lang}, some of the work concerning the energy consumption of code is presented. Thereafter, different approaches to measuring the energy consumption used in other studies will be explored in \cref*{sec:rw_diff_measuring_instruments} to assist in our decision making when choosing which measuring instruments to use in this work. Then in \cref*{sec:rw_measureing_methodology_setup} different works discussing measuring methodology and benchmarks setups will be covered. Finally, in \cref*{sec:rw_key_takeaways} the key aspects from the previous sections which are considered in this work are summarized.
