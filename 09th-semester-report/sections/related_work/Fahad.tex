Another work aiming to compare different measurement methods is in the work by Fahad et al.\cite{fahad2019comparative}. To do this hardware measurements from a HCLWattsUp were used and then compared with energy predictive models, represented by RAPL and on-chip-sensors for Intel CPUs (MPSS). For the experiments conducted a high granularity is required to get the energy consumption of the different application phases. In order to achieve this and make the measurements comparable, the HCLWattUp Meter is used and the concept of Dynamic Energy consumption is introduced. The results should be comparable as the HCLWattUp Meter measurements should be comparable to Intel RAPL's and on-chip-sensors measurements. Dynamic energy consumption is an estimation of the applications power consumption and is calculated using the following formula:\cite{fahad2019comparative}

\begin{equation}
    E_D = E_T -(P_S * T_E)
\end{equation}

Where $E_D$ is the dynamic energy consumption, $T_E$ is the duration of the program execution and $P_S$ is the energy consumption when the system is idle. The dynamic energy consumption will then represent the energy consumption of the test case. The HCLWattUp meter measurements represent the ground truth of the experiments. It is found that RAPL generally under reports the energy consumption of the system. The accuracy of RAPL is also tested for different use cases to see if calibrations are feasible. They found that calibration for the RAPL and on-chip-sensors was generally not possible with their techniques. They provide some recommendations for future works and setup which will be covered in more depth later.
