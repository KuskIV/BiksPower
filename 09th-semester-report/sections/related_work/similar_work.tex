% Has anyone else tried to compare energy measurement tools?

\section{Existing Work}

When considering what existing work already aims to compare the accuracies of different energy measurement tools there exists a few. One is the work by Hackenber et. al\cite*[]{Hackenberg2013}, where Intel's RAPL, AMD's APM with both AC and DC measurings. Here the AC are used as the ground truth, as it is concluded to be very accurate, as $95\%$ and $96\%$ of samples vary with less than 2W in the two tests conducted.

Another work comparing different energy profilers is the work by Jagroep et al.\cite[]{Jagroep2015}.
